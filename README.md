# Publication: Gelmi-Candusso, et al. (2023) Building urban predator-prey networks using camera traps. Food webs.

repository for data and code for:
  ** 1. estimating waiting times between detections
  ** 2. summarizing detections from camera trap data
  ** 3. generating bipartite network from predation events
  ** 4. generating bipartite network from potential encounter events
  ** 5. comparing predator-prey interactions from datasets through a bipartite network
